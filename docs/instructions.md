# [Frontend / Fullstack] Coding Challenge: Real-Time Trading Dashboard

Objective

Design and implement a real-time trading dashboard that displays live ticker prices and
interactive charts for selected financial instruments.

Scope
1. Backend Service (Java/NodeJS/Go)
Build a microservice that:
Simulates or connects to a mock market data feed (e.g., WebSocket or polling)
Streams real-time price updates for a set of tickers (e.g., AAPL, TSLA, BTC-USD)
Exposes a RESTful API to:
List available tickers
Fetch historical price data (mocked)
Subscribe to real-time updates via WebSocket

2. Frontend Dashboard (React + TypeScript)
Create a dashboard UI that:
Displays a list of tickers with live price updates
Shows a real-time chart for a selected ticker (e.g., using Chart.js or Recharts)
Allows users to switch between tickers
Includes basic styling and responsiveness

3. Architecture & Design
Use a microservices-friendly structure
Apply clean code principles and separation of concerns
Include basic unit tests for backend logic
Use Docker for containerization

Bonus Features (Optional)
Add user authentication (mocked)
Implement caching for historical data
Add alerting for price thresholds
Deploy using Kubernetes manifests


Evaluation Criteria
Code quality and structure
Real-time data handling
API and WebSocket implementation
UI responsiveness and interactivity
Test coverage and documentation
Bonus features and overall polish
